This project aims to develop a model capable of identifying tweets that report or discuss natural disasters, which can be useful for real-time disaster monitoring and response systems.
Using a dataset of labeled tweets, various machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and hyperparameter tuning, were applied to achieve high classification accuracy.
